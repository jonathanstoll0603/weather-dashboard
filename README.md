# weather-dashboard
A compact weather dashboard application 

## Description

The Weather Dashboard is a light weight, compact weather mapping application that utilizes Open Weather Map (OWM) API. OWM provides the application with JSON data that utilizes specific user's search criteria in order to provide up-to-date and real-time weather patterns for any given city.

Third party APIs are widely used amongst developers to retrieve large databases of information that would normally be nearly impossible to create on one's own time. As the developer, I was able to navigate through a series of data objects that led me to the specific endpoints I wanted displayed to the user on the UI. In addition to generating these specific endpoints, the application also stores a user's previous search history so that it is retrieved and listed upon page reset. 

As a future add-on to this project, I would like to include a list of serach criteria inputs that the user can select from. These inputs will be used to navigate between different locations of API data object. For instance, if the user wants to see the average level of rainfall on a given day in a given city, they could simply select that argument from a list of options.
